<h1> Hey! </h1>

I'm a Purdue math and computer science student!

Here are a few interesting projects (written in Python, [PHP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvXKmffeMkU), Java, JS) that I've worked on:

- [Every Frame Twitter Bot](https://github.com/bunceandbean/every-frame-twitter-bot) - A Python-based Twitter bot to get the frames of any .mp4 file and post them periodically on Twitter. The project is open source and is currently being used on the Fantastic Mr. Fox movie [here](https://twitter.com/MrFoxFrames).
- [Eras Tour Surprise Song Tracker](https://github.com/bunceandbean/eras-tour-surprise-songs) - A React web app that shows the current surprise songs for Taylor Swfit's Era's Tour. Used by swifties around the world! Currently live and up to date at [suprisesongs.app](https://surprisesongs.app)!
- [benlilley.dev](https://github.com/bunceandbean/bunceandbean.github.io) - A Jekyll-based developer website to host blog discussions, career information, project write-ups, random opinions, and more. Currently live and up to date at [benlilley.dev](https://benlilley.dev)!
- [Advent of Code](https://github.com/bunceandbean/advent-of-code) - A repository full of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions.
- [SchedLink](https://schedlink.com/) - A time management system for Fishers High School students.
- [Fishers Enigma](https://github.com/bunceandbean/FishersEnigma) - An old puzzle game I created from scratch for my friends to participate in.

I am currently studying computer science and mathematics at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/).
