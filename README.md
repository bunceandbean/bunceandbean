I'm a Purdue math and computer science student!

Here are a few interesting projects (written in C, C++, Python, and more) that I've worked on:

- [USC Compiler](https://github.com/bunceandbean/USC-Compiler) - A University Simple C compiler made using LLVM and C++. Once you link a local copy of LLVM to it, it can compile and optimize and USC program!
- [Advent of Code](https://github.com/bunceandbean/advent-of-code) - A repository full of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions.
- [Eras Tour Surprise Song Tracker](https://github.com/bunceandbean/eras-tour-surprise-songs) - A React web app that shows the current surprise songs for Taylor Swfit's Era's Tour. Used by swifties around the world! Currently live and up to date at [suprisesongs.app](https://surprisesongs.app)!
- [SchedLink](https://schedlink.com/) - A time management system for Fishers High School students.
- [benlilley.dev](https://github.com/bunceandbean/bunceandbean.github.io) - A Jekyll-based developer website to host blog discussions, career information, project write-ups, random opinions, and more. Currently live and up to date at [benlilley.dev](https://benlilley.dev)!
- [Fishers Enigma](https://github.com/bunceandbean/FishersEnigma) - An old puzzle game I created from scratch for my friends to participate in.

I am currently studying computer science at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/).
